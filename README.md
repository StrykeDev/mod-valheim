# Valheim Mods

This is the source code for all of my Valheim mods.

If you're interested in my mods or would like a preview you can check out my [Nexus profile](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/110604503?tab=user+files).

## Installation

Compile the mods and put them in the mods directory.

Or download the precompiled version from [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/110604503?tab=user+files) and put them in the mods directory, or use Vortex to automatically install the mods.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome.  
For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
